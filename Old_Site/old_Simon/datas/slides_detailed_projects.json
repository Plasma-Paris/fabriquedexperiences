In days of old they ruled as Kings of Winter; since the Targaryen Conquest they have been Wardens of the North. Their seat, Winterfell, is an ancient castle renowned for its strength. Their sigil is a grey direwolf racing across a field of white, and their words are Winter Is Coming, one of only a few house mottoes to be a warning rather than a boast."

Their seat is Casterly Rock, though another branch exists that is based in nearby Lannisport. Their sigil is a golden lion on a field of crimson. Their official motto is Hear me roar! However their unofficial motto, equally well known, is A Lannister always pays his debts."
